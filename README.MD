This is a simple command line tool to split files into random per-byte summons.

Splitting:
* `-split <file name>` name of the file
* `-n <int>` the number of summon files you want to have

Recovery:
* `-restore` tag is needed to tell the program that you want to recover your file from key files
* `-info <info file name>` program will be initialized with info file, and recover the original file according to it
